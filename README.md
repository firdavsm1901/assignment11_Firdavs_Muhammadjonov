## Project Overview
This project is a part of an assignment focusing on Vue.js. It contains a simple HTML file integrating Vue.js to display an image and a greeting message.

## Files Included

### HTML File

- `styles_part1.css`: External CSS file for styling the HTML elements.
- `script_part1.js`: JavaScript file containing Vue.js code to handle data binding and interactions.

### Vue.js Integration
This assignment utilizes Vue.js (version 2.6.14) via a CDN link to demonstrate basic functionality.

## Project Structure

- `styles_part1.css`: Stylesheet file defining visual attributes.
- `script_part1.js`: JavaScript file responsible for Vue.js functionality.

### Usage
To run this project:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.

## Functionality
- The page exhibits an image sourced from the Vue.js image link.
- The Vue.js script binds the `imageSource` variable to the image source.
